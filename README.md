# customer_behavior_analysis
data analytics project showcasing customer behavior analysis using python SQL  and Power BI
üìä Customer Behavior Analytics Project
üßæ Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior using data analytics tools and techniques.
It covers the entire end-to-end process ‚Äî from data loading and cleaning to exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, Power BI visualization, and professional reporting.
The goal is to extract meaningful insights that can support business decisions and improve customer engagement strategies.

üß© Dataset

Source: Sample e-commerce sales dataset (CSV format)

Records: Contains customer details, product information, transaction data, and revenue metrics

Key Columns: Customer_ID, Gender, Age, Category, Purchase_Amount, Discount, Payment_Mode, Subscription_Status, Rating

üß∞ Tools & Technologies
Tool	Purpose
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)	Data loading, cleaning, and EDA
PostgreSQL	SQL queries and database management
Power BI	Dashboard visualization
Microsoft PowerPoint (Gamma)	Presentation and reporting
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code	Project development environment
‚öôÔ∏è Steps & Workflow
1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Checked for missing values, duplicates, and data types.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed descriptive statistics and data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Analyzed correlations between numerical and categorical variables.

Identified trends in customer age, category preferences, and payment methods.

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formatting.

Standardized categorical data and ensured proper data types.

Prepared the dataset for SQL insertion and dashboard creation.

4. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL.

Executed SQL queries to extract business insights:

Gender-based revenue comparison

Category-wise sales performance

Impact of discounts on revenue

Subscription vs. non-subscription spending trends

5. Power BI Dashboard

Built an interactive dashboard to visualize:

Total customers and revenue by category

Purchase frequency by payment mode

Discount impact and customer segmentation

Enabled dynamic filtering for gender, subscription, and region.

6. Reporting & Presentation

Created a comprehensive report (PDF) summarizing all findings.

Designed a presentation (PPT) using Gamma to present project insights in a visual and concise format.

üìà Results & Insights

Clothing and Accessories generated the highest revenue.

Discounts increased purchase volume but reduced profit margins.

Subscription customers spent 20% more on average than non-subscribers.

Female customers showed higher purchase frequency.

Credit Card and PayPal were the most used payment methods.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run This Project

Clone the repository or download the project folder.

Open the Python notebook (project.ipynb) and run the cells sequentially.

Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and configured.

Import the SQL script (project.sql) into PostgreSQL and execute the queries.

Open the Power BI file (project.pbix) to view the dashboard.

Refer to the project report (PDF) and presentation (PPT) for final insights.

üí° Key Takeaway

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics lifecycle ‚Äî from raw data to business insights ‚Äî using Python, SQL, and Power BI. It highlights practical skills in data wrangling, visualization, and storytelling for real-world analytics roles.
